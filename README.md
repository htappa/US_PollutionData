### Summary
This project examines the U.S Pollution Data dataset which was obtained from the Environmental Protection Agency website. The data is of four major pollutants from EPAâ€™s Air Quality historical dataset which is updated twice a year. Spanning years 2000-2016, the dataset contains over 1.4 million observations and procured from Kaggle.com. Following the EDA cycle, we examine the pollutant AQI for four major pollutants in Washington, DC, Maryland, and Virginia.
